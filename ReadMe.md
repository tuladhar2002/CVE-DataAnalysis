I applied a Data Analysis on the CVE vulnerabilities for a company; Fortinet. 
This is one of my university assesments. 

Steps:
1. Cloned cvelist repo 
2. Removed data before 2020
3. Queried to only get data with company description name object -> Fortinet
4. Saved dataset within scored.json file to seperate the good datas with inaccurate datas
5. Used Pandas and Matplotlib for Data Visualization
